#! 1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid


# You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).
# Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 1
# Output: 12
# Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 5000
# Output: 30228214
 
# Constraints:

# n == grid.length
# 1 <= n <= 5000


#CODE : 
class Solution:
    def numOfWays(self, n: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        # Base case (row 1)
        abc = 6
        aba = 6

        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            new_abc = (2 * abc + 2 * aba) % MOD
            new_aba = (2 * abc + 3 * aba) % MOD
            abc, aba = new_abc, new_aba

        return (abc + aba) % MOD
      
n = 1
sol = Solution() 
last = sol.numOfWays(n)
print(last)
